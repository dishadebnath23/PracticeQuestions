Practice Questions – Java Interview Preparation

This repository contains my daily Java interview practice questions and answers.
Each day focuses on a core Java or Spring Boot concept and includes clear explanations
and simple code examples written with interview expectations in mind.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of Java fundamentals,
problem-solving approach, and ability to explain concepts clearly.

Topics Covered:

Day 1 – Object Oriented Programming (OOPS)
Day 2 – Collections Framework
Day 3 – Java Latest Features
Day 4 – Multithreading
Day 5 – Spring Boot Fundamentals

Each day is organized in its own folder with a dedicated README file
containing the detailed questions and answers for that topic.
